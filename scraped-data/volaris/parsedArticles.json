Established in 2006, the company\u2019s BiblioCore catalog, BiblioWeb web management system, and complete suite of online library experience products is a mission-critical platform that helps to transform Library technology, bringing the best of public libraries to the web, and the best of the web to public libraries. Today BiblioCommons is used by 270 libraries throughout North America, Australia and New Zealand.\u201cAs Founders, we have loved the work of developing the initial product vision alongside a wonderful group of founding libraries.\u00a0 But 13 years in, BiblioCommons is now at a very different stage. We have a broad, industry-leading product suite in production with over 200 libraries.\u00a0 The next phase of growth for BiblioCommons must center on systematically iterating, learning, operationalizing and scaling. There are different organizational skillsets required, and Patrick and I will be leaving BiblioCommons in the hands of a strong management team,\u201d explained Beth Jefferson, Co-Founder and Former CEO.\n\u201cVolaris is the ideal home for BiblioCommons,\u201d Patrick Kennedy, Co-Founder and Former President continued. \u201cTheir experience in guiding and educating Vertical Market Software companies forever is the ideal match for the business and library partners going forward. We are also fortunate to have a skilled leadership team in place with such longevity in so many critical roles \u2013 Marty Tarle, Erica Reynolds, Natasha Hesch and others -- to carry this work forward in partnership with new leadership from Volaris. We have been very encouraged by how quickly the Volaris team grasped both the opportunities and the challenges ahead -- in delivering on the true potential BiblioCommons as a platform for continuing the re-imagine the online customer experience in the years ahead.\u201d\nIn keeping with Volaris\u2019 philosophy of acquire, strengthen and grow, BiblioCommons maintains its brand and independence with support, coaching and best practices from Volaris. Jefferson and Kennedy have decided to transition from BiblioCommons but continue as advocates.
