In addition, given their past eleven acquisitions in this space, there is now a strong customer base for us to access which can help further accelerate our business internationally,” said Martin Dawes, Founder and Principal Shareholder of MDS Global. “We also liked their practice of ‘buy and hold forever,’ as well as their dedication to letting acquired companies run autonomously, maintaining our corporate identity, and enhancing the brand we have worked so hard to build over 3 decades in the market.”<br><br>\n“We are very excited by this acquisition. We are particularly excited that Volaris are professional software people and can help us to grow the performance of our business in every area. This enables us to scale more rapidly beyond our historical base in the UK and Europe to address the needs of new disruptive MVNO’s, IoT providers, and next-generation B2B operators across the globe,” said Gary Bunney, who remains CEO of MDS Global.<br><br>\nMDS Global solutions are deployed on premise and in the cloud, and flagship long-term customers include British Telecom, Telefonica O2, eir, ACN Europe, Telia, Post Office UK, TalkTalk and ID Mobile.<br><br>\n“We are excited to bring a market-leading billing business into our portfolio, in order to complement our existing companies and provide further mission-critical software capabilities to our ecosystem,” said David Nyland, Portfolio Leader and President, Media &amp; Communications vertical at Volaris. “We are particularly impressed with how MDS Global’s managed services capabilities evolved over years, into being the trusted billing platform for major Tier 1 operators.
